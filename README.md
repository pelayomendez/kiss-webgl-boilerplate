# KISS WebGL Boilerplate

This is a simple as possible boilerplate to quickly start personal WebGL demo projects.

The heart of the template is the Javascript 3D library [Thee.js](https://threejs.org/) and from there it may grow with other useful libraries and tools.

It's optimized to be coded with [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and makes use of [Node.js and the npm package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

## How to use

1) Make sure you have [Node.js and the npm package manager](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

2) Clone this repo in any folder. 

3) Install dependencies and run the template:

```
npm preinstall
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```
